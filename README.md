# PAI-Project
For our PAI course project, we are building several disease prediction systems, including heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, and breast cancer classification. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to analyze patient data and improve the accuracy of early diagnosis, providing valuable insights to healthcare professionals.
